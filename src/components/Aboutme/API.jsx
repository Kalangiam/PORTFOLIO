            <h2 className='about'>Experience with API Endpoints</h2>
            <div className='intro'>Throughout my journey as a MERN Full Stack Developer, I've gained valuable experience working with API endpoints. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) serve as the backbone of modern web applications, enabling communication between different software systems and allowing them to exchange data and functionality seamlessly.</div>

            <h2 className='about'>Proficiency</h2>
            <h2 className='about'>Designing and Implementing RESTful APIs</h2>
            <div className='intro'>I am proficient in designing and implementing RESTful APIs, following best practices and industry standards. Whether it's creating endpoints for user authentication, data retrieval, or resource manipulation,I prioritize clarity, consistency, and scalability in API design.</div>



            <h2 className='about'>Handling HTTP Requests and Responses</h2>
            I have a solid understanding of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and status codes, and I leverage this knowledge to handle incoming requests and craft appropriate responses. Whether it's fetching data from a database, validating user input, or returning error messages, I ensure that my API endpoints are robust and reliable.

            <h2 className='about'>Authentication and Authorization</h2>
            I have experience implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms in API endpoints to ensure data security and user privacy. Whether it's using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), OAuth, or session-based authentication, I understand the importance of protecting sensitive information and controlling access to resources.
            <h2 className='about'>Technologies</h2>
            <h2 className='about'>Express.js</h2>
            I leverage the power of Express.js, a minimalist web framework for Node.js, to create robust and efficient API endpoints. Express.js provides a rich set of features for routing, middleware, error handling, and more, allowing me to build RESTful APIs with ease.
            <h2 className='about'>MongoDB</h2>

            I integrate MongoDB, a NoSQL database, into my projects to store and retrieve data from API endpoints. Whether it's performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) or executing complex queries, MongoDB's flexibility and scalability make it an ideal choice for modern web applications.
            <h2 className='about'>Postman</h2>

            I utilize Postman, a popular API development tool, to test and debug my API endpoints during development. Postman's intuitive interface, comprehensive feature set, and robust testing capabilities help me ensure that my APIs function as intended across different environments and scenarios.
