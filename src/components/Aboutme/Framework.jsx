    <h2 className='about'>Experience with Frontend Frameworks and Libraries</h2>
    <div className='intro'>I've had the opportunity to work with a variety of frontend frameworks and libraries to create engaging and responsive user interfaces. These tools empower developers to streamline the development process, enhance the visual appeal of web applications, and ensure a seamless user experience across devices and browsers.</div>

    <h2 className='about'>Proficiency</h2>
    <h2 className='about'>Bootstrap</h2>
    <div className='intro'>Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework that provides a collection of pre-built components, layouts, and utilities for building responsive and mobile-first websites. I am proficient in leveraging Bootstrap to rapidly prototype user interfaces, create grid systems, and customize styles using its extensive set of CSS classes and components.</div>



    <h2 className='about'>Material UI</h2>
    Material UI is a React component library that implements Google's Material Design principles, offering a wide range of customizable and reusable UI components. I have experience incorporating Material UI components into React.js projects to achieve a modern and visually appealing design aesthetic while maintaining consistency and usability across different screens and devices.

    <h2 className='about'>Tailwind CSS</h2>
    Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to build custom designs by composing utility classes directly in HTML. I am adept at using Tailwind CSS to rapidly prototype and iterate on UI designs, leveraging its intuitive utility classes to style elements, apply responsive layouts, and manage spacing, typography, and colors with ease.
    <h2 className='about'>React.js</h2>
    React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, renowned for its component-based architecture, virtual DOM, and declarative syntax. I have a strong command of React.js fundamentals, including JSX syntax, state management, props and event handling, and lifecycle methods, allowing me to create dynamic and interactive UI components that seamlessly integrate with backend APIs and data sources.
    <h2 className='about'>Technologies</h2>
    <h2 className='about'>HTML/CSS/JavaScript</h2>
    I have a solid understanding of core web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which form the foundation of frontend development. Whether it's structuring content with HTML, styling elements with CSS, or adding interactivity with JavaScript, I leverage these languages to create intuitive and accessible user interfaces that meet design specifications and user requirements.
   
    <h2 className='about'>React Router</h2>
    I utilize React Router, a popular routing library for React.js, to implement client-side routing and navigation in single-page applications. React Router enables me to define dynamic routes, handle URL parameters, and manage navigation transitions, providing users with a seamless browsing experience while maintaining the integrity of the application's UI state.

    <h2 className='about'>Redux</h2>

    In addition to React.js, I have experience using Redux, a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, to manage complex application state and data flows. Redux facilitates centralized state management, allowing me to efficiently share and update application state across components, debug state changes, and implement advanced features such as time-travel debugging and middleware integration.
